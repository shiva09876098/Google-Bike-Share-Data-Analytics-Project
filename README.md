Google Bike Share Data Analytics Project Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing the Google Bike Share data to identify trends and provide insights into how users interact with the bike-sharing system. The dataset includes details about the trips taken by customers, such as the duration of rides, customer demographics, and location-based data.

The primary goal is to perform a thorough analysis to help the bike-sharing company understand customer behavior, optimize operations, and potentially increase ridership.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns in the dataset. Data Visualization: Using visualizations to communicate the insights. Model Development: Predictive analysis on the most common routes, busiest times, and customer preferences. Dataset Information The dataset used in this project is provided by Google Bike Share. It includes the following key fields:

ride_id: Unique identifier for each ride. rideable_type: Type of bike (classic, electric, etc.). started_at and ended_at: Timestamps for ride start and end. start_station_name, end_station_name: The stations where the ride started and ended. member_casual: Type of customer (member or casual rider). Download the dataset from Google Bike Share Data.

Tools and Technologies R: Primary tool for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. Tidyverse: Collection of R packages for data science. ggplot2: For data visualization. dplyr: For data wrangling. RStudio Cloud: Development environment.

Project Workflow Data Cleaning: Converting timestamps, removing duplicates, and handling missing values. Exploratory Analysis: Analyzing ride durations, peak usage times, and user types. Data Visualization: Creating charts for common routes, ride durations, and user demographics. Predictive Analysis: Applying models to predict popular routes and peak hours. Results and Insights Peak Hours: Most rides occur between 8 AM - 10 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM. Most Popular Routes: The route between Station A and Station B is the busiest. User Demographics: Casual users tend to take longer rides than members. Contributing Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for suggestions or improvements.
